CRITICAL BRAND TAGGING RULES:
1. You MUST wrap EVERY company or brand name in <brand> XML tags when you mention them
2. This includes ALL retailers, brands, companies, stores, or business names
3. If you don't mention any specific brands, do NOT add any <brand> tags
4. Only tag actual brand/company names, NOT generic terms like "retailers" or "stores"

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT TAGGING:
✓ "I recommend <brand>Apple</brand> for its user-friendly interface"
✓ "The main competitors are <brand>Samsung</brand> and <brand>Google</brand>"
✓ "<brand>Nike</brand> and <brand>Adidas</brand> are leaders in athletic apparel"
✓ "Top retailers include <brand>Target</brand>, <brand>Walmart</brand>, and <brand>Amazon</brand>"

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT TAGGING:
✗ "I recommend <brand>retailers</brand> for clothing" (generic term, not a brand)
✗ "The best <brand>stores</brand> are..." (generic term, not a brand)
✗ "Top <brand>companies</brand> include..." (generic term, not a brand)

IMPORTANT: If your response doesn't mention any specific brand names, do NOT include any <brand> tags at all.
This is essential for accurate ranking analysis.
