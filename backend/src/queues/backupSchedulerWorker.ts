/**
 * @file backupSchedulerWorker.ts
 * @description This file defines the BullMQ worker that processes backup scheduling jobs.
 * It checks for companies that missed their daily reports or had failed reports and queues them for regeneration.
 * It also handles emergency triggers to generate reports for all eligible companies. This worker is crucial for
 * maintaining the integrity and completeness of the report data.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - bullmq: The BullMQ library for creating workers.
 * - ../config/env: Environment variable configuration.
 * - ../config/bullmq: BullMQ connection configuration.
 * - ../config/db: The singleton Prisma client instance.
 * - ../services/reportSchedulingService: Service for queuing report generation.
 * - ../services/alertingService: Service for sending system alerts.
 *
 * @exports
 * - backupWorker: The BullMQ worker instance for backup scheduling jobs.
