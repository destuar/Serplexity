# Security Checklist for Production Deployment

This document outlines critical security considerations and checks that must be performed and verified before deploying Serplexity to a production environment. Adhering to these guidelines is paramount to protecting user data, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring business continuity.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Strong Authentication:**
    *   Ensure robust password policies (complexity, length, rotation) for all internal and external users.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts and sensitive operations.
    *   Verify brute-force protection mechanisms are in place (e.g., account lockout, rate limiting on login attempts).
    *   Properly secure Google OAuth integration, ensuring correct callback URLs and client secrets.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   Use secure, randomly generated session IDs.
    *   Implement appropriate session timeouts and inactivity limits.
    *   Ensure sessions are invalidated upon logout, password change, or suspicious activity.
    *   Protect JWTs (Access and Refresh Tokens) from XSS/CSRF attacks (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, secure storage for access tokens).
*   **Authorization (Access Control):**
    *   Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) where applicable.
    *   Verify that all API endpoints enforce proper authorization checks (`authGuard`, `paymentGuard`, `CompanyGuard`).
    *   Prevent Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) by validating that the authenticated user has permission to access the requested resource (e.g., `companyId` checks for multi-tenant awareness).
    *   Ensure sensitive actions require re-authentication or additional authorization.

## 2. Data Security

*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   **In Transit:** Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all communication (frontend to backend, backend to external services like LLMs, Stripe, AWS).
    *   **At Rest:** Ensure PostgreSQL database (RDS Multi-AZ) and Redis (Elasticache) have encryption at rest enabled. Verify S3 and Glacier storage also use encryption at rest.
*   **Data Validation & Sanitization:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection, XSS).
    *   Ensure LLM prompts are properly sanitized to prevent prompt injection attacks where user input is incorporated.
*   **Sensitive Data Handling:**
    *   Never store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, payment details) in plain text. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for passwords.
    *   Minimize the storage of sensitive data. If not needed, don't store it.
    *   Properly handle and redact sensitive information from logs.

## 3. Infrastructure Security

*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   Ensure all sensitive environment variables (`JWT_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, LLM API keys, `DATABASE_URL`) are managed securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) and are NOT hardcoded or committed to version control.
    *   Verify `.env` files are excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).
*   **Network Security:**
    *   Implement strict firewall rules (Security Groups in AWS) to restrict access to necessary ports and services only.
    *   Isolate database and Redis instances in private subnets.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits.
*   **Container Security (Docker, ECS Fargate):**
    *   Use minimal, hardened base images.
    *   Run containers with the least necessary privileges (non-root user).
    *   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure proper logging and monitoring of container activity.
*   **Cloud Security (AWS):
    *   Adhere to AWS security best practices (IAM roles with least privilege, security groups, VPCs).
    *   Regularly review AWS configurations for misconfigurations.
    *   Utilize AWS services like GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudTrail for threat detection and auditing.

## 4. Dependency Management & Software Supply Chain

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy) into the CI/CD pipeline for both backend and frontend dependencies.
    *   Regularly review and update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:**
    *   Implement mandatory peer code reviews for all changes, with a focus on security implications.
    *   Ensure security-aware developers are part of the review process.

## 5. Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response

*   **Comprehensive Logging:**
    *   Log security-relevant events (login attempts, access denials, critical system changes, errors) with sufficient detail.
    *   Ensure logs are immutable, centrally stored, and protected from unauthorized access.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive data.
*   **Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   Set up alerts for suspicious activities, failed login attempts, unusual traffic patterns, and system errors.
    *   Monitor API usage and LLM interactions for anomalies.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   Have a clear, well-defined incident response plan in place for security breaches.
    *   Regularly test the incident response plan.

## 6. Application Security Best Practices

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement graceful error handling that avoids revealing sensitive system information in error messages to users.
    *   Log detailed error information internally.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Apply rate limiting to all public-facing APIs to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Security Headers:**
    *   Ensure appropriate HTTP security headers are set (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).
*   **File Uploads:**
    *   If file uploads are implemented, ensure strict validation of file types, sizes, and content to prevent malicious uploads.
*   **LLM Security:**
    *   Implement safeguards against prompt injection, data leakage, and hallucination when interacting with LLMs.
    *   Consider input/output filtering for LLM interactions.

## 7. Regular Audits & Penetration Testing

*   **Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular internal and external security audits.
    *   Perform penetration testing by independent security experts before major releases and periodically thereafter.
*   **Compliance:**
    *   Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and industry standards.

This checklist is a living document and should be continuously updated as the project evolves and new threats emerge.
