- `test:backend`, `test:frontend`: Individual test runs  
- `test:coverage`: Coverage reports
- `test:watch`: Watch mode for development

### 2. ⚠️ Payment Controller Testing (14 tests)
**Status: PARTIALLY WORKING - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

**ISSUES DISCOVERED:**
- **Stripe Mock Problems**: `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` returning `undefined`
- **Checkout Session Errors**: 500 status instead of 200 - Stripe instance mocking issues
- **Token Field Fix Applied**: Changed `registerRes.body.token` → `registerRes.body.accessToken` ✅
- **Supertest Chaining Fixed**: Corrected `.set().get()` → `.get().set()` ✅
- **Schema Field Corrections**: Removed non-existent `stripeSubscriptionId` field ✅
- **Subscription Status**: Should be `'cancelled'` not `'inactive'` for deletions

**PASSING TESTS (4/14):**
- Unauthenticated request rejection ✅
- Request body validation ✅  
- Missing priceId handling ✅
- Stripe configuration endpoint ✅

**FAILING TESTS (10/14):**
- Checkout session creation (500 error)
- Stripe customer reuse (500 error)
- All webhook tests (constructEvent returning undefined)
- Error handling tests (mock setup issues)

### 3. ✅ User Controller Testing (26 tests)
**Status: CORRECTED BUT NOT RE-TESTED**
- Fixed token field name: `token` → `accessToken`
- Fixed route URLs: Added `/me/` prefix where needed
- Removed non-existent `stripeSubscriptionId` references
- Enhanced validation and error handling

### 4. ✅ Infrastructure Improvements
- **Authentication Error Alignment**: Fixed middleware response expectations
- **Route URL Corrections**: All API paths now match actual implementation
- **Database Schema Compliance**: Removed references to non-existent fields
- **Mock Configuration**: Improved but still has Stripe webhook issues

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. **Stripe Webhook Mocking** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
```javascript
// Current Issue: constructEvent returns undefined
mockStripeInstance.webhooks.constructEvent.mockReturnValue(mockEvent);
// Causes: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')
```

### 2. **Stripe Instance Mock Configuration** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY  
```javascript
// Checkout sessions failing with 500 errors
// Mock not properly intercepting Stripe API calls
```

### 3. **Subscription Status Values** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Database expects: `'active'`, `'cancelled'`
- Test expects: `'active'`, `'inactive'`
- **FIX**: Update test to use `'cancelled'`

---

## NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### A. **Fix Payment Tests** (Critical)
1. **Webhook Mock Fix**: Ensure `constructEvent` returns proper event object
2. **Stripe Instance Mock**: Fix customer and session creation mocks  
3. **Status Value Alignment**: Update tests to use correct subscription statuses
4. **Re-test Payment Controller**: Verify all 14 tests pass

### B. **Implement Report Controller Testing** (High Priority)
- Create comprehensive tests for `reportController.ts`
- Test report generation workflow
- Mock LLM service calls
- Test scheduling and status updates

### C. **Add LLM Service Testing** (High Priority)  
- Mock external AI service calls
- Test prompt generation and response parsing
- Validate error handling for API failures

### D. **Complete Test Coverage Verification**
1. Run full test suite to verify ~99 tests pass
2. Generate coverage report
3. Identify remaining gaps in untested code
