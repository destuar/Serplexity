Bug: `company.test.ts` fails intermittently due to read replica lag. The tests create a company and immediately attempt to read it, but the data has not yet replicated. A temporary fix of mocking `prismaReadReplica` was implemented and reverted. The long-term solution is to investigate and resolve the replication lag itself.

Update: `company.test.ts` now mocks `prismaReadReplica` to point to the primary database during testing. This is a temporary measure to stabilize tests and address immediate failures. True read replica testing requires a more sophisticated setup that simulates replication lag. This will be addressed in a future task.
