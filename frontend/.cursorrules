Serplexity Cursor Rules — Frontend

Stack & Structure

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 7 + Tailwind + Radix UI + Recharts.
- Path alias: @ → frontend/src. Feature-first organization (components/pages/contexts/hooks/services/types).

Design North Star

- Tech-forward, space, futuristic, liquid glass (glassmorphism). Prioritize brand expression.
- Accessible by default; keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes where applicable.

Data & API

- API client in lib/apiClient.ts; services under src/services. Do not call fetch directly in components.
- Types in src/types; Zod for runtime validation when parsing untrusted data.
- Auth tokens via contexts/hooks (AuthContext/useAuth). No secrets in client code.

Components & State

- Keep components small and composable; lift state thoughtfully; avoid props drilling via contexts.
- Prefer controlled components with React Hook Form + Zod for forms.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize expensive computations; use stable keys.

Routing

- React Router; guard protected routes with components under components/auth (e.g., ProtectedRoute, FreemiumGuard, PaymentGuard).

Testing & Quality

- Vitest + RTL; JSDOM. Coverage target ≥70%.
- Test components in isolation; add integration tests for key flows.

Build & Commands (absolute paths)

- Dev: cd /Users/diegoestuar/Desktop/Serplexity/frontend && npm run dev
- Build: cd /Users/diegoestuar/Desktop/Serplexity/frontend && npm run build && npm run lint
- Tests: cd /Users/diegoestuar/Desktop/Serplexity/frontend && npm run test
- Preview:cd /Users/diegoestuar/Desktop/Serplexity/frontend && npm run preview

Conventions

- Use Tailwind utilities; keep classNames readable; factor repeated patterns into UI components under components/ui.
- Keep files ≈≤200 LOC; extract logic into hooks under src/hooks.
- No inline large JSON or static assets in code; place under public/ when appropriate.

Performance

- Lazy-load route-level pages; code-split large feature bundles.
- Prefer derived data with useMemo; avoid excessive effect dependencies.

Environment

- Use VITE_API_URL for backend base URL. Do not hardcode endpoints.

Exit Checklist per edit

- Build OK, tests OK, lints clean, UX matches design north star, concise summary provided.
